# Data Mining

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of data mining exercises, experiments, and implementations developed as part of academic coursework and personal study. The project explores essential concepts in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, pattern discovery, and predictive modeling.

The goal of this repository is to provide clear, reproducible examples of data mining workflows using widely adopted tools and methodologies.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, normalization, encoding, and feature selection  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): statistical summaries, visualizations, and pattern identification  
- Classification and clustering models: implementation and evaluation of common algorithms  
- Model assessment: accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and cross‑validation  
- Notebook‑based workflow for clarity and reproducibility  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit‑learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
